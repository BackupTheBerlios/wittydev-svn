In graph theory, a tree is a graph in which any two vertices are connected by exactly one path. [1]
Any connected graph with no cycles is a tree.[1]


In computer science, a B-tree is a tree data structure that keeps data sorted and allows searches, 
insertions, and deletions in logarithmic amortized time. It is most commonly used in databases and 
filesystems. [3]
