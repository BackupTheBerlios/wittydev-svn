Online identity management (OIM) [1]
	is a set of methods for generating a distinguished presence of a person on the Internet. 
	OIM is a part of another discipline called Search Engine Optimization with the difference 
	that the only keyword is the person's name, and the optimization object is not necessary 
	a single web site; 
	A survey by CareerBuilder.com found that 1 in 4 hiring managers used search engines to 
	screen candidates. 
	One in 10 also checked candidates' profiles on social networking sites such as MySpace 
	or Facebook [2]. 
	Roughly half of U.S. hiring officials use the Internet in vetting job applications
