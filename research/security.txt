J2EE Session IDS Generation
	The important properties of a session ID should be that it is unique, and it is not possible 
	for one user to guess another user's session ID. [3]
	
	Netcraft Recommendations [3]
		=> There should be some real random input to the session IDs if they are to be used as 
		the sole means of session
		=> Any meaningful data being used in session IDs should be one-way encrypted. 
		
	Recent versions of Sun's Java servlet code (from version 2.1) use a session ID system, which 
	includes a large random component. However, developers building application servers should 
	enhance the code to make the session count inaccessible.
	
	
	Apache Tomcat
		Starting with version 3.2, Tomcat uses a secure rando number generator, and maintain 
		uniqueness of session IDs without leaking the session count.
		
	Sessions allow web applications to maintani state. HTTP is a stateless protocol. 
	Three methods are used to perform this function : cookies, GET form data, and POST form data.
	Developers use on or more of these methods to propagate the SID from one page to the next so 
	that a users session can be maintained
			
J2EE Session Attacks [4]
	Session attacks consist of two major cateogires: 
		Session Hijacking
		Session Fixation
	
	Session Hijacking are hijacked in one or three ways
		Prediction 	: Occurs when a malefactor realizes that a pattern exists between SIDs
				  Some SIDs are more predictable then others. Some SIDs may be hashed or
				  contain information such as ip addresses or timestamps. This information
				  makes prediction more difficult, but not unpredictable
		Brute force	: Occurs when a malefactor repeatedly tries numerous SIDs until he happen
				  a valid one.
				  
		Interception	: Occurs when a malfactor is able to extract data allowing him to 
				  determine the SID. The methods to intercept SIDs are generally more 
				  complicated than the methods of brute force and prediction.
		
	Security flaws that that allow interception:
