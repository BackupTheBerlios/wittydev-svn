Due to their length, the terms "Internationalization" and "Localization" are frequently abbreviated to i18n 
(where 18 stands for the number of letters between the i and the n in internationalization, a usage coined 
at DEC in the 1970s or 80s[1]) and L10n respectively. 
The capital L on L10n helps to distinguish it from the lowercase i in i18n. [2]



Globalization (G11N) [rif.1]
	is the process of developing a program whose features and code design are not solely based on a single language or 
	locale. Globalizing an application involves two independent steps: internationalization and localization. 
	Globalization aims to address all of the unique challenges an enterprise faces as it expands to the global market.

Internationalization (I18N) [rif.1]
	is the process of developing code in such a way that it is completely independent of any culture-specific information. 
	Fully internationalized applications can be localized to a particular country or region without any changes in the 
	program code. An application that supports internationalization will have the following characteristics:


Localization (L10N) [rif.1]
	is the process of adapting an application, ideally one which has already been properly internationalized, to run 
	in a particular locale, country, or linguistic market. This includes displaying all text in the native language, 
	and using native conventions for formatting and sorting. It takes into account such details as national regulations 
	and holidays, cultural sensitivities and gender roles, and local currency. The goal is for the final service or 
	product to appear as if it was developed within a local culture.
