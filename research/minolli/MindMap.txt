A mind map, or concept map, is a way of thinking and organising your ideas in a graphical way. [1]

A mind map is a diagram used to represent words, ideas, tasks or other items linked to and arranged 
radially around a central key word or idea.  [2]

It is used to generate, visualize, structure and classify ideas, and as an aid in study, organization, 
problem solving, decision making, and writing. [2]

A mind map is similar to a semantic network or cognitive map but there are no formal restrictions on 
the kinds of links used. [2]

The elements are arranged intuitively according to the importance of the concepts and they are organized 
into groupings, branches, or areas. The uniform graphic formulation of the semantic structure of information 
on the method of gathering knowledge, may aid recall of existing memories. [2]

Mind maps (or similar concepts) have been used for centuries [2]

The mind map can be contrasted with the similar idea of concept mapping. The former is based on radial 
hierarchies and tree structures, whereas concept maps are based on connections between concepts. [2]

Concept mapping is a technique for visualizing the relationships among different concepts.
Concepts are connected with labelled arrows, in a downward-branching hierarchical structure. 
The relationship between concepts is articulated in linking phrases, e.g., "gives rise to", "results in", 
"is required by," or "contributes to". [3]

A well made concept map grows within a context frame defined by an explicit "focus question," while a 
mind map often has only branches radiating out from a central picture. [3]

Another contrast between Concept mapping and Mind mapping is the speed and spontaneity when a Mind map 
is created. A Mind map reflects what you think about a single topic, which can focus group brainstorming. 
A Concept map can be a map, a system view, of a real (abstract) system or set of concepts. Concept maps are 
more free form, as multiple hubs and clusters can be created, unlike mindmaps which fix on a single 
conceptual center. [3]



Dr. Allan Collins can be considered the father of the modern mind map. [2]

The claim to the origin of the mind map has been made by a British popular psychology author, Tony Buzan. [2]

The use of the term "Mind Maps" is trademarked by The Buzan Organisation, Ltd. in the UK[6] and the USA.[7] 
The trade-mark does not appear in the records of the Canadian Intellectual Property Office.[8]


Tony Buzan suggests using the following foundation structures for Mind Mapping: [2]
   1. Start in the center with an image of the topic, using at least 3 colors.
   2. Use images, symbols, codes, and dimensions throughout your Mind Map.
   3. Select key words and print using upper or lower case letters.
   4. Each word/image must be alone and sitting on its own line.
   5. The lines must be connected, starting from the central image. The central lines are thicker, organic and flowing, becoming thinner as they radiate out from the centre.
   6. Make the lines the same length as the word/image.
   7. Use colors – your own code – throughout the Mind Map.
   8. Develop your own personal style of Mind Mapping.
   9. Use emphasis and show associations in your Mind Map.
  10. Keep the Mind Map clear by using radial hierarchy, numerical order or outlines to embrace your branches.[1]


What can you use mind maps for? [1]
	Here are some of the things you can use a mind map for:
    * think of ideas at the start of a project
    * make notes from what you read or from a lesson
    * plan a project or investigation
    * analyse a character in a book
    * plan a review of a book or play
    * plan an essay
    * revise key points for an exam.


 	
Tips for mind maps [1]
	Here are some reminders and tips for making a mind map:
    * If you are using paper, use a large sheet and turn it sideways.
    * Put the main idea in the centre and work outwards.
    * Leave lots of space so you can add things in.
    * Use key words.
    * Use arrows to link ideas.
    * Use colours. On paper, you can go over the map with coloured highlighters.
    * Add pictures.
