Facelets has several compelling features: [1]
	* Templating (like Tiles) 
	* Composition components 
	* Custom logic tags 
	* Expression functions 
	* Designer-friendly page development 
	* Creating component libraries 


Unlike JSP, Facelets is a templating language built from the ground up with the JSF 
component life cycle in mind. With Facelets, you produce templates that build a component 
tree, not a servlet. 
This allows for greater reuse because you can compose components out of a composition of 
other components. 

Facelets is similar to Tapestry and Tiles.


Installing Facelets
	1- Add the Facelets library
		jsf-facelets.jar 
		
	2- Modify the JSF application's web.xml, and add the init parameter(s) [2]
		<context-param>
			<param-name>javax.faces.DEFAULT_SUFFIX</param-name>
			<param-value>.xhtml</param-value>
		</context-param>

	3- Add the FaceletViewHandler to the faces-config.xml file
		<application>
			<locale-config>
				<default-locale>en</default-locale>
			</locale-config>
			<view-handler>com.sun.facelets.FaceletViewHandler</view-handler>
		</application>
