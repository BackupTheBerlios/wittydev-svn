JavaServer Faces technology is a server-side user interface component framework for Java
technology-based web applications.


The main components of JavaServer Faces technology are as follows:
- An API for representing UI components and managing their state; handling events,
server-side validation, and data conversion; defining page navigation; supporting
internationalization and accessibility; and providing extensibility for all these features
- Two JavaServer Pages (JSP) custom tag libraries for expressing UI components within a JSP
page and for wiring components to server-side objects
