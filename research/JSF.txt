JavaServer Faces technology is a server-side user interface component framework for Java
technology-based web applications.


The main components of JavaServer Faces technology are as follows:
- An API for representing UI components and managing their state; handling events,
server-side validation, and data conversion; defining page navigation; supporting
internationalization and accessibility; and providing extensibility for all these features
- Two JavaServer Pages (JSP) custom tag libraries for expressing UI components within a JSP
page and for wiring components to server-side objects


Installing JSF
	1- Add the JSF libraries:
			- jsf-api.jar		: Sun JSF API
			- jsf-impl.jar		: Sun JSF Implementation
			- el-api.jar		: Sun Expression Language API 
	
	2- Modify the application web.xml to map the FacesServlet servlet [1]
		<servlet>
			<display-name>FacesServlet</display-name>
			<servlet-name>FacesServlet</servlet-name>
			<servlet-class>javax.faces.webapp.FacesServlet</servlet-class>
			<load-on-startup>1</load-on-startup>
		</servlet>
		<servlet-mapping>
			<servlet-name>FacesServlet</servlet-name>
			<url-pattern>/SomeFolderName/*.jsf</url-pattern>
		</servlet-mapping>


JSF ViewHandler
	A JSF ViewHandler is a plug-in that handles the Render Response and Restore View 
	phases of the JSF request-processing life cycle for different response-generation 
	technologies, including Facelets. [6]
	

MyFaces 
	is an open source implementation of JSF that provides many additional validators, 
	including some that are not included in JSF. See Resources to learn about MyFaces. [5]
